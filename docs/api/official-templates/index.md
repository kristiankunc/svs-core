# Official templates

SVS provides a set of official [templates](/#template) that can be used to create common services.

## Available templates

- **[nginx](nginx.md)**: A template for deploying the NGINX web server.
- **[mysql](mysql.md)**: A template for deploying the MySQL database server.
- **[adminer](adminer.md)**: A template for deploying the Adminer database management tool.


## Customization

As a general rule, SVS does not really interfere with the image configuration therefore to customize a certain service behaviour, you should refer to the official image documentation usually found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) or the image's official website/GitHub repository.
