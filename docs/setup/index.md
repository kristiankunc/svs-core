# How to get started

- First, you need to [install the application](quickstart.md).
- Then you run your first [hello world service](hello-world.md).

??? note "Do not want to commit to the full setup?"
    If you do not wish to go through the full setup process, you can try using the pre-configured sandbox environment aimed at quick testing, not for production use. Docs can be found [here](./sandbox.md).

**Additionally**, you may wish to set up a web UI for easier management. See the instructions for [web setup](web.md).
